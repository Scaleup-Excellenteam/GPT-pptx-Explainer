    "1": "The goal of this course is to introduce the terminology and concepts related to the Internet. We will delve into more depth and detail later on. We will use the Internet as an example to understand concepts such as protocols, network elements like hosts and access networks, physical media, packet and circuit switching, Internet structure, network performance factors like loss, delay, and throughput, as well as security, protocol layers, service models, and a brief history of the Internet.",
    "2": "The Internet is a network of interconnected ISPs, with protocols like TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, and 802.11 controlling message sending and receiving. Internet standards are defined by RFC (Request for Comments) and overseen by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).",
    "3": "The Internet is an infrastructure that offers services to various applications like the Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce, and social networks. It provides a programming interface for applications and hooks to connect them to the Internet. The Internet also offers service options similar to a postal service.",
    "4": "A protocol is a set of rules that define how communication should occur. In human protocols, this can be seen through interactions such as asking for the time, asking questions, or making introductions. Similarly, network protocols govern communication between machines on the Internet. They determine the format and order of messages sent and received, as well as the actions taken upon message transmission and receipt."
